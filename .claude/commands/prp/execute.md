description: Begin or continue implementation of PRP tasks in the "TODO.md" file.
---

Look at the "TODO.md" file to decide what is the next actionable task that needs to be worked. Make sure to look at the overall file to know the context for the task. Think very hard about how a senior engineer might work that specific task. If there is great uncertainty in how to proceed then ask questions, but if you can reasonably work it out then go ahead and implement that task.

As you complete work, be sure to update the "TODO.md" file, adding a date string with the current date as you mark items complete.

If you've completed a task, go ahead and keep going until every task in the "TODO.md" file is completed.
