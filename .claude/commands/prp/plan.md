description: Create a plan of implementation for the "PRP.md" file.
---

Look at the "PRP.md" file to see what the current agenda is. Think very hard about how to implement this requirement, then write up a list of detailed implementation steps inside "TODO.md" using normal tasks. Be sure to double check against the most recent documentation pages to get the latest information. The goal is a task list that has sufficient technical direction that a junior developer could reasonably be expeccted to complete the work without additional input.
