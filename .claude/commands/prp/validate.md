Look at the "PRP.md" file, which is the overall feature change request, and see if it's ready for someone like a junior developer to implement it. It should have clear user or business value, and describe the desired outcome in enough detail that someone could reasonably look at the results of the work and know if the PRP was completed successfully.

Provide feedback about the PRP. If there are any areas that need justification, ask user or business related questions that will help clarify the value. If there are any areas that need clarification of direction, ask questions that will help guide implementation thinking.

Do not make changes to the file. Do not be overly picky.
